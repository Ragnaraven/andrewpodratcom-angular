The year after that, I began planning a world, a story and gameplay mechanics. While I am not ready to fully reveal the story, below, you can see the beginnings of my low poly art style and the some of the gameplay mechanics. <br/> <br/> I breifly paused development to create \"The Ultimate Zombie Game\" to take on the behometh of multiplayer development. When I finished that project, I realized that I care too much about the story to botch the execution of Ragnaraven. I have decided to continue my writing and design so that once I am well experienced I will be able to make Ragnaraven the game it deserves to be. Since then, I have decided to dabble with City Builder and Ghost Game to continue learning and gaining game development wisdom from these smaller scope projects.",
